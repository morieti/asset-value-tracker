# Asset Value Tracker

In this project I want to track prices of some assets (Including Stock Market, Gold, ...) from about 25 years ago in US
Dollar. This will help investors to learn how much of their profit is not actually profit and is caused by Iran's
inflation rates.

This also shows when an asset had excellent opportunity to rise and benefit its stakeholders.

This project has to major parts: one worker to get prices and updates the data in a time-series database; and a web
service to show the charts and help the investors to decide.
